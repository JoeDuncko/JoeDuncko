# Hi, I'm Joe!

## My goal is to use technology to create products that make people's lives easier, simpler, and more fun.

I am currently a Software Engineer at [@brdg-ai](https://github.com/brdg-ai), where I focus on creating the tools that power our machine learning pipeline.

In my spare time I help organize [@codeyoungstown](https://github.com/codeyoungstown).

In a past life I co-founded [@TheEventDiscoveryCompany](https://github.com/TheEventDiscoveryCompany). In a past past life I co-founded [@HackYSU](https://github.com/HackYSU) and [@penguinhackers](https://github.com/penguinhackers).

Looking for my next passion project. 

`Let's create, together.`
