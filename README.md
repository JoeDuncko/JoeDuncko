# Hi, I'm Joe!

## Frontend engineer and community organizer based in Youngstown, Ohio

I am currently a Senior Frontend Engineer at [BlastPoint]https://blastpoint.com/.

I also serve as an Entreprenuer in Residence (EIR) at the [Youngstown Business Incubator (YBI)](https://ybi.org/), where I run the MVP Development Program. That program is made possible by the talented students that I work with at [Dev Youngstown](https://www.youngstown.dev/), my consultancy firm.

In my spare time I help organize [Code Youngstown](https://codeyoungstown.com/).

In a past life I co-founded [@TheEventDiscoveryCompany](https://github.com/TheEventDiscoveryCompany). In a past past life I co-founded [@HackYSU](https://github.com/HackYSU) and [@penguinhackers](https://github.com/penguinhackers).

Looking for my next passion project.
